Artist: Jay-Z & Kanye West f/ Elly Jackson
Album:  Watch the Throne
Song:   That's My Bitch
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uhh
Hello, can I speak to uhh, uh
Yeah you know who you are, look
You have no idea what you dealin with
Someone on some of this realest shit
Pop champagne, I'll give you a sip
'Bout to go dumb, how come? Yeah that's my bitch
That's my bitch
Sh-shorty right there, that's my bitch
That's my bitch

[Chorus: Elly Jackson]
I've been waitin for a long long time
Just to get up and throw my hands up high
and live my life, and live my life
Just to get up and throw my hands up high

[Kanye West]
Yeah...
I paid for them titties, get your own
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
You say I care more about them Basquions
Basquiats, she learnin a new word, it's yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too $hort called, told me "I fell in love with her"
Seen by actors, ball players and drug dealers
and some lesbians that never loved niggaz
+Twisted Love Story+, true romance
Mary Magdalene, from a pole dance
I'm a freak huh? Rock star life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryin to play second fiddle?
No disrespect, I'm not tryin to be-little
But my dick worth money I put "Monie in the Middle"
(Where she at? In the middle)

[Chorus] + "high, high, high"

[Interlude]
Sweatin to the licks and mixes 'til mornin
I'm yearnin, oh yeahhhh
Could I get a little dab of your potion
Slow motion, oh yeahhhh

[Jay-Z]
Go harder than a nigga for a nigga, go figure
Told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
How could someone so gangsta be so pretty in pictures
Ripped jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Picasso was alive he woulda made her
That's right nigga, Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white?
Put some colored girls in the MOMA
Half these broads ain't got nuttin on Lavonia
Don't make me bring Thelma in it
Bring Halle, bring Penelope and Selma in it
Uhh~! Back to my Beyonces
You deserve three stacks, word to Andre
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in mu-seums
You belong in vintage clothes crushin the whole building
You belong with niggaz who used to be known for dope dealin
You too dope, for any of those civilians
Now shoo children, stop lookin at her tits
Get your own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch

[Chorus] + "high high high"</pre>
