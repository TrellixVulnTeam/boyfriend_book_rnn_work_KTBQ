Song:   Lift Off
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro]
"All engine running..."

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
And we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the starrrrrs
How many people you know can take it this farrrrr?
I'm super-charrrrrged
I'm 'bout to take this whole thing to Marrrrrs
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the starrrrrs
You don't know what we been through to make it this farrrrr
So many scarrrrrs
I'm 'bout to take this whole thing to Marrrrrs

[Kanye West]
Lift off.. lift off, takin my coat off
Showin my tattoos, I'm such a show-off
Huh? I feel the pain and then rolled off
I got the whole city, they about to go off
How many niggaz with me up in this biatch?
How many people wanna roll on me now?
Like you know, na-na-na, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Lift off, off, AH!
Like you know, na-na-na, you know me by now
Know me, know me by now
You know, know me by now
Know me, know me, by now

[Jay-Z]
Lift off
Rappers hear "Watch the Throne" they gon' be pissed off
Earth is boring to 'em, shit is makin my dick soft
When you Earnhardt as me eventually you hit a big wall
Five-four, three-two, we need fuel, lift off

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
"20 seconds and counting. T minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal.
 12, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start.
 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. All engine running.
 Lift off! We have a lift off!" {*echoes*}

[Outro: Beyoncé]
And we gon', and we gon', and we gon', and we gon'
And we gon' take it to the moon
And we gon', and we gon'
And we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the starrrrrs
And we gon' take it to the moon... take it to the starrrrrs
How many people you know can take it this far?
Take it to the starrrrrs
How many people you know can take it this far?
Now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now we gon'</pre>
