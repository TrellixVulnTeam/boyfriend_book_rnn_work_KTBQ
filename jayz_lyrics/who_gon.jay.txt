Artist: Jay-Z & Kanye West
Album:  Watch the Throne
Song:   Who Gon Stop Me
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: Kanye West] + (Jay-Z)
This is somethin like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die I'ma fuckin ball
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me huh?
(Black cards, black cars, black on black, black broads)
(Whole lot of money in a black bag)
(Black strap, you know what that's FOR)

[Jay-Z] + (Kanye) or {both}
(Who gon' stop me huh?)
{Who gon' stop me huh?}
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need eight arms
One neck but got eight charms {who gon' stop me huh?}

[Kanye West]
Niggaz talkin, they bitch made
Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's pig latin, itch-bay
Who gon' stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator
If you gettin paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just 'sposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist
Well, I guess that's on one basis...
I only like green faces

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, yeah, let's go! Who gon' stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldn't be wise to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, six to six
Gimme one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white wearin no socks
No ceiling, new Coupe
They know I'm a dope boy they don't have no proof
I'm three steps removed, I know how to move
It's lookin like I don't know how to lose
I'm winnin again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gambling
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7
I went through hell I'm expectin heaven
I'm owed, some dough
And I stuck to the G Code
I'm here, oh yeah
I promise I ain't goin nowhere
Okay here, like a hare
Like a rabbit, I like karats/carrots
I'm allergic to havin bunny ears
Like broke, like nope
Like ha~! I ain't no joke
I can't be stopped, like nope
Like nope... extend the beat more

Uhh, two seats in the 911
Uhh, no limit on the black card
Uhh, told y'all I was gon' go H.A.M.
Uhh, 'til the ocean was my backyard
Uhh, no lies in my verses
Hey, please pardon all the curses
Hey, shit gotta come out some way
Fuck, when you growin up worthless
Uhh, middle finger to my old life
Uhh, special shout out to my old head
Uhh, if it wasn't for yo' advice
Uhh, a nigga would have been so dead
Uhh, I'm livin life 'til these niggaz kill me
Turn this up if you niggaz feel me
I'm riding dirty tryin to get filthy
Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a muh'fuckin fool if you wanna
Street smart and I'm book smart
Could have been a chemist cause I cook smart
Only thing that can stop me is me
And I'ma stop when the hook start
Hold up

[Chorus]</pre>
