Artist: Kanye West f/ Jay-Z, Kid Cudi, Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock, Charlie Wilson
Album:  My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
Song:   The Joy
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield -  from "The Makings of You"] (Pete Rock) {Charlie Wilson}
Add a little sugar (AHHOW~!!) 
Honey suckle lamb (Whoo!!)
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you could'nt miiiiiiss... {uh-huh...}
...with a dozen roses {eh-eh-eh...uh} (Mr. West)
Such would astound you (...Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you (Uh)
These are the makings of you (Whoo!)

[Kanye West]
I do it for the forefathers, yeah the street authors
That are not A&Rs in a cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us (AHHOW!!)
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place
and she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Takin refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty, so it's not that bad
but I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield -  from "The Makings of You"] (Pete Rock) {Charlie Wilson}
Add a little sugar (Whoo!!)
Honey suckle lamb (C'mon!)
A great big expression of happiness (AHHOW!!)
Boy, you could'nt miiiiiiss... {uh-huh...} (Uh...)
...with a dozen roses {eh-eh-eh...uh} (Kanye)
Such would astound you (...Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you (Uh)
These are the makings of you (Yeah)

[Kanye West]
No electro, no metro 
A little retro - ahh, perfecto
You know the demo, ya boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy's back in style
Now when Rome got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they black - they sistas
They momma named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your Fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
...This beat deserves Hennessy
and bad bitch, and a bag of weed - the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed, well mine's an obscenity 

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield -  from "The Makings of You"] (Pete Rock) {Charlie Wilson} [Jay-Z]
Add a little sugar (Whoo!!) 
Honey suckle lamb (C'mon!) [Red lights..]
A great big expression of happiness (AHHOW!!)
Boy, you couldn't miiiiiiss... {uh-huh...} [Make that thing roll]
...with a dozen roses {eh-eh-eh...uh} (Kanye)
Such would astound you (...Pete Rock) [Uh]
The joy of children laughing around you (Uh)
These are the makings of you (Yeah)

[Jay-Z]
(AHHOW!!) ...This is my momma shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood
when I was back on my pa-jama shit
Afros and marijuana sticks 
Seeds and the ganjas had it poppin like the sample that I'm rhymin with
Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid, they surprised I don't needle pop
Takin sips of pop, six packs of {?}, Pink Champale
Ballentine L, Ballys on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit I used to balance on a scale
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
Virgin Marys try to judge her, I'm like, "Where the Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria, they said
"You raised that boy too fast", but you was raising a warrior
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us
Uh!

[Kid Cudi]
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Yeah...

[Pete Rock - Outro]
It's Pete Rock... Kanye...
One two... Okay...
It's Pete Rock... Kanye...
One two... Okay...
It's Pete Rock... Kanye...
One two... Okay...
It's Pete Rock... Kanye...
One two... Okay...</pre>
